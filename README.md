# win-ten-cpp
A simple single-player tennis game simulation similar to pong, implemented in object-orientated C++ using the native Windows GDI+ and GUI APIs.

## Usage

* On starting the application the introduction screen will be displayed. The game will enter "demo mode" after a short time where both sides play each other automatically.
* Hitting any key in the introduction screen or demo mode begins the single-player game.
* The right side is the player's paddle, the left side is the computer opponent (non-playable character). 
* The up and down arrow keys control the player's paddle. 
* The objective is to avoid letting the ball hit the back wall (right hand side wall) behind the player's paddle. When the ball hits the wall behind the oponent the player's score increases. 
* The first side to five points wins the game.
